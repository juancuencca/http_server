# HTTP Server

HTTP server is capable of handling simple GET/POST requests, serving files and handling multiple concurrent connections. This project is inspired on the [Code Crafters http server project guidelines](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview)

## Quick Start

Ensure you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then, run the following command.

```bash
$ cargo run
```
